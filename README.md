## 📌 Goals

- Implement classic algorithms with clean and optimized code
- Practice solving algorithmic problems across different topics (arrays, strings, graphs, etc.)
- Build foundational and advanced data structures from scratch
- Focus on readability, performance, and clean design
- Organize code in a modular and scalable way
